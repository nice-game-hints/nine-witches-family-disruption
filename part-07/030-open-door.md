title: Opening the door out
---

The door is locked with some kind of electronic locking mechanism.

# How to open it?
There must be a lever somewhere that unlocks the door.

# Where?
Did you check the door that is before the electronically locked door? ^[ Get in with Krakovitz ghost form. ]

# There's a lever!
Pull it. 

# I can't
Oh, right. Make Lundgren pull the lever. The door unlocks!
