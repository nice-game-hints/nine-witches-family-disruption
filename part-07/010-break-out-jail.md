title: Breaking out of the jail
---

The cell door is locked.

# What to do?
Krakovitz can get out in ghost form.

# What to do?
Is the guard out there? ^[ Akiro should use the toilet, first. ]

# Yes he is
Maybe he would open the cell door.

# How?
As Krakovitz, get out and suggest him to open the jail door.

# But he is still there!
You can lure him away.

# He is still hangin in the passageway
Eliminate him!

# How?
Electrocute him!

# How!?
Take control of him and tell him to touch one of those broken wires.
