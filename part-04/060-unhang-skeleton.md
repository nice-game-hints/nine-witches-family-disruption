Father Olsen's remains are hanging there in the bell tower.

# How to let the skeleton loose
Go look at the setup. Especially the wire.

# What about it?
You should cut the steel wire with something. ^[ You need to look at it to get further. ]

# With what?
Ask around. Maybe there is a place where you could *buy* it.

# Where?
In Waldemar's shop, at town. You just need [29 coins](070-twentynine-coins.md). ^[ Remember, you need to look at the wire before you can ask Waldemar about the wire cutters. ]

# I have enough coins
Buy the pair of pliers. You can use them to cut the wire.
