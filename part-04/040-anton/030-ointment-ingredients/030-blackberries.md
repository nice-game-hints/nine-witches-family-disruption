title: A handful of blackberries
---

There's blackberries in one place.

# Where?
In the first house in the town. With Baltasar.

# How to get the berries?
Yeah, Krakovitz cannot take them. You would need to get Akiro in.

# How?
With a key?

# Where is the key?
You have to look around. Look around the house. ^[ Use Krakovitz's ghosts scanning ability. ]

# Tell me what
On the right side of the house there is a bush. There you find the key.

# I have the key
Now you can enter the house and take some of those blackberries.
