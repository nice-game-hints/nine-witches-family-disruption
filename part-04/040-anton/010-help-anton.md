title: Prevent Anton from killing himself
---

Talk to Anton and ask for the ointment. Anton is in dark mood as someone butchered his dog and all *nine* hens.

# Those bastards!
Is there any hope left?

# Is there?
Did they really kill all *nine* hens?

# Nine hens...
Hmm... did you look at the hen remains?

# I looked them
There was only *five* hens in the pile...

# It means...
There's four more somewhere! There's hope! Talk to Anton about this.

# Four hens
