Four of Anton's hens are missing. They shouldn't be far. ^[ Go to the next cabin on the left. There's your first hen. ]

# I found one!
Now, catch it.

# It doesn't let
You need something to distract it and keep it in one place.

# Something like?
Something the hens eat? ^[ There's some corn kernels next to Anton's cabin. Grab a handful. ]

# I have some treats for it
Great. Now, spread some core kernels to the ground. The hen will eat them.

# It escapes
Deal with it like you did with Josef.

# What do you mean?
Don't let it see *you* while it is eating the corn kernels.

# So?
Spread some kernels into the ground. When the hen starts to eat them, approach it from *behind* and grab the hen.

# I got it!
Great! Now, one by one, put them back into the hen house.

# They are all in
Go tell Anton.
