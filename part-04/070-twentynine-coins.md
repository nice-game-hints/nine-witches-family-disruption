title: Getting 29 coins
---

The pliers, at the shop, cost 29 coins.

# Where to get that amount of money?
You have done this before, you know.

# Collected money?
Yes, what was the best way to get money around here?

# The books?
Yup. Burn another anti-fascist book.

# What book?
The book Anton was reading. If you can't get it you should [help him with his hens](040-anton/020-four-hens/index.md), first.

# I got the book
Burn it in the Flammenbuch-48. You get 45 coins! That is enough for pliers!
