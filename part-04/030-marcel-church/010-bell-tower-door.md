The bell tower door is closed with a key.

# What to do?
Did you visit the bell tower as Krakovitz, already?

# Yes!
There's that skeleton hanging from the rope. It's spirit must be somewhere.

# Where?
Change Krakovitz to his spirit form inside the church (not the bell tower). ^[ Talk to the soul. ]

# Father...
It is Father Olsen. After talking to him the door is now open.
