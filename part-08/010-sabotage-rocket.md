The rocket is charging at the temple.

# What to do?
You could climb up the ladders and just pull the plug.

# I cannot do it!
Yeah, the Maschinen-571 is running and could fry you.

# How to infere it?
Look around. There isn't many places to go.

# What is the correct place?
Go to the lighthouse. Open the door and go up. Pull the lever.

# It is on
The lightbeam will interfere the Maschinen-571 and you can pull the plug.
