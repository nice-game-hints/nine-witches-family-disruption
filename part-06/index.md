title: Part 6 - The Eklipse Fest
---

Finally, after [getting the invitations](/part-05/index.md), you get to the Eklipese Fest.
But first, check out the ritual place. ^[ Look into the hole at the cliff. ]

Every part contains the bare minimum for passing that specific part. So, if you don't find hints for specific puzzle it might be in one of the future parts.

# Weird.. but party is on!
Mingle and talk to the partiers. Especially with [von Darka](010-talk-to-darka.md).

# What should happen?
You have to talk to *all* the guests to get forward. Also the dancing brothers.
