Chancellor is talking with von Darka. Von Darka cannot escape the situation.

# What can I do?
Try to talk to von Darka, first.

# Yeah, he is stuck
Maybe you should do something to the chancellor.

# What?
Like, something disruptive.

# Tell me
Pop his balloon.

# With what?
You would need a needle.

# Where do I get that?
How hard is it to find a needle around here? I would say it is as hard as finding a needle in a haystack.

# Haystack...
There is a cart with hays in front of the cabin with the pigs and goats. Search the haystack.

# I have the needle
Pop the chancellor's balloon with the needle. Be sure to highlight the balloon, not the chancellor.
