title: Coins at the market area
---

As soon as Schmidt drives his food truck into the market area ^[ [Contact the resistance](../020-violinist/index.md) and visit the town. ] Josef will drop *four coins* into the ground.

# Josef is watching me!
Yes, Josef won't let you collect the coins.

# What to do?
He is drunk enough that you don't have to get rid of him.

# You mean?
By timing your actions right you can collect the coins right *in front of his eyes*.

# You mean...
Well, not in *front* of his eyes. But on his back.

# So?
Collect the coins when Josef is walking *away* from you. You need to time this correctly. You can collect all three coins like this.
