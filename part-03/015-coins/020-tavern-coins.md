There are piles of coins on the tavern tables.

# How to get them?
Looting will be punished by death, you know?

# Yeah, yeah...
Herbert is keeping his eyes peeled for looters.

# How to distract him?
Give hims something else to do.

# What?
He really likes to keep the tavern atmosphere high so that the German soldiers come to drink there.

# Atmosphere?
You know, lights, tidyness and *music*.

# Music?
He wants the record player to be playing.

# So?
Touch the record player. It stops playing and Herbert comes and fixes it.

# Okay...
While he is fixing the record player it is your change to grab some change from the tables. You can nick both tables and collect total of *eight coins*.
