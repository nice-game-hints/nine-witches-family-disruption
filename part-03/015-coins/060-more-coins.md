There is one more way to make lots of coins around here.

# What?
The nazis really like to burn all of those anti-fascist books.

# Book burning!
The Flammenbuch-48 machine, at the tavern, will pay well for anti-fascist books.

# Where do I get a book?
Try to get to places.

# What places?
Locked basements. ^[ Try to get into the tavern basement through the outside doors. ]

# How do I open the doors?
You would need a suitable tool. [Contact the resistance, first. ](../020-violinist/index.md)

# I can walk over the southern bridge
Great, go find the tool. ^[ There is a crowbar inside the middle cabin. ]

# I found the tool!
Open the tavern basement doors with the crowbar.

# I'm in
Move the crate to find "The Little Communist" book. Perfect fuel for Flammenbuch-48. Put it into the machine. You get *eleven coins*.
