Sauerkraut is party...krhm, writing a report for general von Darka.

# How to contact him?
Hermann is watching the door. Maybe there's another way to reach Sauerkraut.

# Like?
Have you got a look of his house already? ^[ Krakovitz can walk through doors as a ghost. ]

# Yes
Did you spot any *device* that could be used to contact him?

# You mean?
The phone, yes. ^[ Look at the phone as ghost Krakovitz to get its number. ]

# Oh, now I see...
You just need to call him!

# From where?
From the tavern.

# I need the phone plan
Collect [26 coins](../015-coins/index.md) and buy the basic plan from Herbert. You can then call Sauerkraut using his phone number. ^[ Look at the phone, the number is different in each play. ]
