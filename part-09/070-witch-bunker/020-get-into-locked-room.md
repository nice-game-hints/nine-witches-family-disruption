title: Getting into the locked room in the submarine base
---

The door, where the chancelor and others were is locked.

# How to get there?
You should find a key. ^[ It is a rusty key. ]

# Where?
Quick question: Did you [recover the sacred stone](/part-09/010-recover-stone/index.md) and [find the witch's sisters](/part-09/020-witchs-sisters/index.md)?

# Yes
Then you should find it from the forest.

# Two-headed creature
After killing all the creatures, talk to the two-headed creature. He will drop the rusty key.
