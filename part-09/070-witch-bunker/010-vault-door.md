The witch is behind the vault door in the submarine.

# How to open it?
Quick question: Did you [recover the sacred stone](/part-09/010-recover-stone/index.md) and [find the witch's sisters](/part-09/020-witchs-sisters/index.md)?

# Yes
Okay, cool. What I can say is that you can't find any key to the vault door.

# What then?
Try to get into [the locked room](020-get-into-locked-room.md).

# I got there
You could *blow* the vault open.

# Blow?
With dynamite! ^[ There's dynamite in the room. ]

# I have the dynamite
Put it into the vault door and light it up with the matchbox.
