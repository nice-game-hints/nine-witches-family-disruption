Get the witch out of the bunker so she can do the reverse ritual.

# She is behind the vault door
I really suggest you advance other bits of the story, first.

# What bits especially?
[Recover the sacred stone](/part-09/010-recover-stone/index.md) and [find the witch's sisters](/part-09/020-witchs-sisters/index.md)?

# I did those!
Okay, then [open the vault door](010-vault-door.md), next.

# It is open
[Wake her up.](030-wake-witch.md)
