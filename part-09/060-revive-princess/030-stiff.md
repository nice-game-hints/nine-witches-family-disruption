You gave the rose some [fertilizer](010-fertilizer.md) and [water](020-water.md).

# It is not stiff and upright enough
*Stiff* you say?

# Yes, stiff...
You know there is this stuff that makes, krhm, surfaces stiff.
Did you visit [the plane](/part-09/050-plane.md)?

# I did! What stuff?
The intimate cream. ^[ You can find it in the place in the crate. ]

# I have the cream
Put some of it into Princess to revive it fully.
