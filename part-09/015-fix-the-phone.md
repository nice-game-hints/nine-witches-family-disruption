The phone at Sauerkraut's house is mute.

# How to fix it?
There must be something wrong with the communications. Did you spot any mention about communications center?

# Where?
In the submarine. You get there after attending [the Eklipse Fest](/part-06/index.md). It is the green door left from the vault.

# I found it!
Good. Pull the lever to fix the communications electricity.

# There's no power...
It must be that bad wiring.

# Bad wiring
You know, where Reinthaller met his destiny.

# How to fix the wires?
With tape, of course. ^[ There's some duct tape in the far right room with green door. ]

# I have duct tape
Fix the wiring. ^[ There are two places. One immediately after the green door and the other behind the corner. ] Pull the lever to enable communications, again.
