# Like?
Like horse manure etc.

# Horse manure?
You remember? There was some. ^[ At the ambush site. ]

# Right!
Get to the ambush site and pick up some manure.

# Not with my bare hands!
Fine, get a plastic bag. ^[ There's a plastic bag at [the mine field](/part-09/030-minefield.md). ]

# I have the bag
Use it on the manure to pick it up. Give the manure to the flower. ^[ Use the interplanetary beam to get to the moon. ]
