title: The dark cave
---

After [getting over the minefield](/part-09/030-minefield.md) you get into the dark cave.

# It is so dark
It is. Some light would be nice.

# How?
Check out the ??? in the middle.

# Clay bowl...
Maybe that is your light source.

# What to do to it?
Put some flammable stuff there and light it up.

# Help me
 - Put some gasoline into the bowl ^[ There is a gas can in front of the tank on the eastern bridge. ]
 - Use matches on it ^[ You find a matchbox [in the crashed plane.](/part-09/050-plane/index.md) ]

# And then there was light!
Nice, off to [the tunnels](010-tunnels.md)!
