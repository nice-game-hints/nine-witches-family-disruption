title: Navigating the tunnels
---

After you got [some light](index.md) into the cave you can visit the tunnels.

# I keep getting out
Did you notice there are four tunnels? You have to find the correct tunnels to go into. First hint: Don't go back where you came from.

# Okay, any more hints?
Well, I really couldn't find *any* hints what could be the correct way in each station. You just have to try and fail.

# Tell me the correct sequence
Okay. If the tunnels are numbered from left  to right, 1 to 4, the correct sequence is: 2, 4, 1, 3.

# I did it!
Good. After the fish pond you get to [a hall with nine empty chairs](/part-09/020-witchs-sisters/index.md).
