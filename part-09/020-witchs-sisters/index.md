Witch's sisters. Where could they be?

# Yeah, where?
Have you already explored [past the mine field](/part-09/030-minefield.md)?

# Yes
So, you got [into the cave](/part-09/040-cave/index.md), then. I think you are close to the answer.

# I found the hall
[Summon the sisters.](010-summon.md)

# They are there...
Krakovitz can talk to them. Switch to the ghost form.

# Ashes...
Edda cremated the other witches bodies. You would [need their ashes](020-ashes.md) to summon them to some other place, like the cliff.
