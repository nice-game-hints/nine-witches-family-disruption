The motorcycle is missing a spark plug.

# Where to get one?
Look around. After looking at the motorcycle options have opened in different places.

# Tell me where I get one!
At the shop, in the town. It costs 80 coins.

# I don't have that much!
Go forward with other story bits. You will get rich soon.

# What bits?
[Help father Olsen.](/part-05/040-father-olsen/010-bury-remains.md)

# And then?
Look around. The soldiers usually have lots of money.

# Where?
In the cabin with pigs and goats outside. You can visit it as Krakovitz. [Get Akiro in the cabin, also.](../030-enter-the-cabin.md)

# He is in...
Search the cabin. ^[ Go through both the trousers. You get over 80 coins from there. ]

# I have over 80 coins!
Go buy the spark plug from the store.
