The door is locked with the latch from the inside.

# How to open it?
Someone from the *inside* should open it.

# So?
[Have you helped Father Olsen](/part-05/040-father-olsen/index.md), already?

# Yes
Then Krakovitz can suggest simple thoughts into person's mind.

# And?
You can use the soldier inside the cabin. Go inside as Krakovitz. Command the soldier to follow you closer to the door^[ First "talk" to the soldier. Then go to a point with no targets and select the implant action. The soldier will follow. ]. Command him to remove the latch on the door.

# Can't still get in
Well, the soldier is still watching around.

# What to do?
Maybe it is time for soldiers to get some sleep.

# So?
Move the soldier closer to the beds and command him to sleep in the bed. Akiro can now enter the cabin.
