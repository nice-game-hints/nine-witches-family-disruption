title: Part Five - Invitations
---

You have to walk back to the ambush site. You can get to the ambush site from the west bridge.

# What there?
Walk all the way left to meet the developers. [Find the motorcycle they hid](010-find-hidden-motorcycle.md) and [fix it](020-repair-motorcycle/index.md).

# I got there!
You are at the ambush site? Nice! Now, just find Otto von Zelluloid ^[ He lays in the tall grass.] and take the invitations from him. Show the invitation at the east bridge.
