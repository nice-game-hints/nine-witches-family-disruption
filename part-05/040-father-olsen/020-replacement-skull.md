Father Olsen's skull shattered when you let the skeleton loose.

# Where to find a replacement skull?
Now, you will bump to a spare skull soon.

# Soon?
Go on with the adventure. [Get the permit from Sauerkraut](/part-04/010-obtain-permit.md) and try to go into the Okkulte-55 area.

# I did that!
Okay, did you try to go to the ambush site? With [the hidden motorcycle](../010-find-hidden-motorcycle.md)?

# I found the motorcycle
Okay. Well, look closely. ^[ The spare skull is on the right hand side of the cabin next to the motorcycle. ]

# I found the skull!
Great! Put it into the bury pit.
