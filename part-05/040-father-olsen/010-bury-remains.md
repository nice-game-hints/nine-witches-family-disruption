Father Olsen will teach Krakovitz new tricks if you just bury his remains, first.

# Where are the remains?
Well, they are hanging at the bell tower. [Cut the skeleton free.](/part-04/060-unhang-skeleton.md)

# It is freed
Well, then the remains are all over the church. Collect them all:
 - left leg
 - right leg
 - left arm
 - right arm
 - chest

# How about the skull?
Yeah, it shattered. [Find a replacement skull](020-replacement-skull.md)

# I have the skull
Great! Now, but all the bones into the pit and [shovel](030-shovel.md) some soil into it.
