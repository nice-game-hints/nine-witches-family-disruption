title: Buying the shovel
---

There is a shovel for sale in the town's shop. It costs 60 coin.
You can't get that much money until you get to the part 5.

# I am in part 5!
Great, then find the coins for the shovel.

# How to get enough coins?
 - There's coins on the table at the cabin where Marcel is resting
 - There's coins on Sauerkraut's table in the town

They should be enough to buy the shovel.
